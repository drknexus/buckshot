This package will provide an R (S4) interface to "shotgun", the
(large-scale) parallel coordinate decent solver for lasso and sparse
logistic regression written in C++ ... we can't let MATLAB have all
of the glory!

Shotgun is developed at CMU by Aapo Kyrola, Joseph Bradley,
Danny Bickson, and Carlos Guestrin.
