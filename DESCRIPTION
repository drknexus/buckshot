Description: This package provides an R (S4) interface to "shotgun", the
  (large-scale) parallel coordinate decent solver for lasso and sparse
  logistic regression written in C++.
  .
  The shotgun C++ library made its debut at ICML 2011 and is developed
  by Aapo Kyrola, Joseph Bradley, Danny Bickson, and Carlos Guestrin in
  the SELECT lab at CMU. See the URLs for further references.
